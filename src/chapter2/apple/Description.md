<h3>Notes on chapter 2</h3>
<p>
By taking forming classes <strong>AppleSimpleFormatter</strong>, <strong>AppleFancyFormatter</strong> and <strong>AppleFormatter</strong> interface we now able to print description
in easy way by simply adding new class <strong>AppleFormatter</strong>  implements AppleFormatter interface. Thus we don't need to write ugly code
and refactor it each time we want to change our text output in <strong>ApplePrinter</strong>
